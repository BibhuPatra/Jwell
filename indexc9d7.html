    <td colspan="2"><p>The owner of &quot;A Spa for you&quot; is who provided my services. If you are truly looking for a customized massage and facial I would highly recommend. My services were outstanding. She interviewed me for 30 min before we started to understand my areas of tensions and preferences. Very cool! <br />
With that in mind though, if you are looking for a very &quot;spa feel&quot;, ie. the locker room, showers, fancy waiting/relaxing area, water with cucumber, hot tub, etc. this is not your spot. The spa is located in an apartment complex that is business and residential--therefore the location is not glamorous. The room &amp; bathroom are simple and clean. The space is extremely small. You do hear outside noise.<br />
I was happy to support a local, small business owner.</p>
